<!-- GramAI

GramAI is an AI-powered phone helpline that helps rural citizens understand and access government welfare and financial schemes through a simple phone call. It is designed for people who may not use smartphones, mobile apps, or the internet, and works entirely through spoken conversation in the caller’s local language. -->

<!-- Many government schemes exist for farmers, workers, women, and low-income households, but a large number of eligible citizens are either unaware of them or unsure about how to apply. Language barriers, complex eligibility rules, and dependence on intermediaries often prevent people from receiving benefits they qualify for. GramAI aims to reduce this gap by making scheme information easy to access, accurate, and personalized.

A user interacts with GramAI by calling a helpline number from any basic phone. The system listens to the caller, identifies the language being spoken, and guides the conversation naturally instead of using rigid IVR menus. GramAI asks a few simple questions, such as age range, occupation, or location, only to the extent required to understand eligibility.

Based on this information, GramAI evaluates which government schemes may apply to the caller. It then explains these schemes in clear, simple language, covering key benefits, required documents, and where the user can apply. The entire interaction is voice-based and does not require reading, typing, or navigating digital interfaces.

Alongside citizen interactions, GramAI also provides an administrative dashboard. This dashboard shows aggregated and anonymized insights from calls, such as which schemes are most frequently discussed, which regions show lower awareness, and how users are engaging with the system. These insights can help authorities improve outreach efforts and identify gaps in scheme awareness at the ground level.

GramAI is built as a modular system so that language processing, eligibility evaluation, and conversation flow can evolve independently. The project focuses on accessibility, inclusivity, and clarity, with the goal of making public welfare information reachable to everyone, regardless of language, literacy level, or access to technology. -->
